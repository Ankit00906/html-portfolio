<h1>The best movies of all time according to Ankit</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>This movie is soo much entertaining along with knowledge that even if you are alone in this world , that doesnot define your future.
    you can be the superhero in last.
</p>

<h3>M S Dhoni the untold story</h3>
<p>Entertaining as well as quite emotional.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Ring</h3>
<p>Amazing and one of the best movie in world. It tells that your height can be small but you can have lots of courage.
    Height cannot define your path to infinity.</p>
